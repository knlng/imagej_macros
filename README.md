# README

These macros aim to speed up evaluations of confocal images with the software ImageJ (Fiji).

They can be downloaded as ijm files and then used via drag and drop into the ImageJ window. They can be used in a semi-automatic evaluation of confocal images, either separately or put together to build a larger macro file.
